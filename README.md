# Solar Energy Project

- This is a project involves MLOps processes such as data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, model training, experiment tracking, and monitoring, and finally deploying on Heroku using flask API
- this part of final assignment of course ["<i>Omdena - MLOps for AI Engineers and Data Scientits</i>"](https://omdena.com/course/mlops-for-ai-engineers-and-data-scientists/)

## Folder structure

- `client-app` - it flask app for utilizing ML model through RESTful API which deployed on Heroku
- `datasets` - data collection and data cleaning process's output is stored here
- `model` - It contains all three trained ML models (linear regression, random forest, gradient boost), and actual and predicted values visualization
- `notebooks` - contain python notebook source code for all processes we did in this project (data cleaning, data exploration & data visualization, model training, experiment tracking & monitoring)
- `screenshots` - MLflow and Neptune tracking results, and API response from local and Heroku APIs
