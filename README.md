# Solar Energy Project

- This is project involved MLOps process such as data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, model training, experiment tracking and monitoring, and finally deploying on heroku using flask API
- this part of final assignment of course ["<i>Omdena - MLOps for AI Engineers and Data Scientits</i>"](https://omdena.com/course/mlops-for-ai-engineers-and-data-scientists/)

## Folder structure

- `client-app` - it flask app for utlizing ML model thorugh RESTful API which deployed on heroku
- `datasets` - data collection and data cleaning process's output is stored here
- `model` - It contain all three trained ML model (linear regression, random forst, gradient boost), and actual and predicted values visualization
- `notebooks` - contain python notebook source code for all process we did in this project (data cleaning, data exploration & data visualization, model training, experiment tracking & monitoring)
- `screenshots` - MLflow and neptune tracking results, and API response from local and heroku APIs
